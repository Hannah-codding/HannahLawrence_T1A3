R5

Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to.

Reference the chosen style guide appropriately.

R6

Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:

- at least THREE features

- describe each feature


Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:

- use of variables and the concept of variable scope

- loops and conditional control structures

- error handling


Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .

R7

Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan.

Provide screenshots/images and/or a reference to an accessible project management platform used to track this implementation plan. 


> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.

R8

Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
- how to use any command line arguments made for the application
